## 1. Motivation üåé


### Background  
As a team of four immigrants navigating the complex U.S. immigration system, we personally experienced the challenges of filling out multiple forms, understanding eligibility requirements, and finding reliable information. There was no single, trustworthy platform where all our questions could be answered efficiently. The process was time-consuming, stressful, and often confusing, which inspired us to develop **BureauBot** ‚Äî a chatbot designed specifically to simplify the immigration process.

Although a few emerging AI tools provide limited assistance with immigration-related questions or automate form entry for specific use cases, there is currently **no comprehensive, consumer-facing solution** that integrates both ‚Äî **conversational guidance and automated form-filling** ‚Äî across a wide range of U.S. immigration forms. Most existing tools either focus on a single form type (e.g., naturalization) or are designed for legal firms rather than individuals.  

This clear gap in accessibility and usability motivated us to build **BureauBot** ‚Äî a unified platform that not only answers immigration queries with accuracy and reliability but also assists users in completing and generating properly filled immigration forms tailored to their specific situations.

### Common Challenges Faced by International Students and Immigrants
- **Information Overload:** Immigrants often have to search across multiple government websites and documents to find the right forms and instructions.  
- **Complex Forms:** Many forms are lengthy, with technical language and conditional sections, making them difficult to fill correctly without guidance.  
- **Eligibility Confusion:** Determining which forms apply to a specific case is not always straightforward.  
- **Time and Stress:** The process is slow, stressful, and prone to errors, leading to delays or incorrect submissions.  

### Common Challenges Faced by International Students and Immigrants
- **Information Overload:** Immigrants often have to search across multiple government websites and documents to find the right forms and instructions.  
- **Complex Forms:** Many forms are lengthy, with technical language and conditional sections, making them difficult to fill correctly without guidance.  
- **Eligibility Confusion:** Determining which forms apply to a specific case is not always straightforward.  
- **Time and Stress:** The process is slow, stressful, and prone to errors, leading to delays or incorrect submissions.  
- **High Cost of Professional Help:** When unsure, many individuals turn to immigration attorneys or consultants, which can be very expensive, especially for students or first-time applicants.

### Goals & Value Proposition
BureauBot aims to **streamline and simplify the immigration process** for individuals by:  
1. **Answering Queries:** Users can ask questions about immigration forms, eligibility, and required documentation, and get precise, reliable answers.  
2. **Form Guidance:** BureauBot directs users to the correct forms based on their specific circumstances.  
3. **Automated Form Filling:** Users can input their personal details, and BureauBot will fill out the forms accurately, minimizing errors and saving time.  
4. **Domain-Specific Focus:** Unlike general-purpose chatbots, BureauBot is trained exclusively on immigration forms and processes, ensuring high accuracy and relevance.

### Why BureauBot Matters  

BureauBot is more than just a chatbot ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **technically advanced and socially meaningful solution** designed to address real-world challenges faced by immigrants and international students:  

- **Bridging an Unmet Need:** While some AI tools assist with legal or immigration-related queries, none currently combine **LLM-based conversation** with **automated form completion** ‚Äî filling a critical market gap.  
- **Technical Complexity:** BureauBot integrates multiple advanced components ‚Äî **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for natural language understanding, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for factual accuracy, and **PyMuPDF** for automated form population. This fusion demonstrates strong engineering and system design capability.  
- **High Impact and Accessibility:** By offering accurate guidance and form-filling support, BureauBot reduces dependency on expensive attorney consultations, providing a **cost-effective, accessible alternative** for immigrants.  
- **Scalability:** Its modular architecture allows future expansion into related domains like tax filing, visa renewals, and other legal aid applications.  
- **Capstone Significance:** The project exemplifies a **comprehensive AI system** ‚Äî combining research, model development, data integration, and user-centered design ‚Äî making it an ideal showcase of technical depth, creativity, and societal relevance.  


By addressing these pain points, BureauBot reduces the cognitive load on immigrants, increases confidence in form submissions, and provides a **single, reliable platform** for immigration guidance.

### Methodology
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Leveraged Gemini 2.0 to understand user queries and generate precise responses. The model was fine-tuned on immigration forms and metadata from official sources to ensure domain-specific accuracy.  
- **Form Metadata Extraction:** Downloaded official immigration forms and extracted metadata (field names, requirements, conditions) to train the model to recognize and correctly fill each section.  
- **Multi-Step Prompting:** Applied iterative prompting techniques to convert free-form user input into structured data suitable for form filling. This ensures that all user details are correctly mapped to the corresponding fields.  
- **Automated Form Population:** Integrated Pymupdf to fill forms programmatically based on the structured output from the LLM, producing ready-to-submit documents.  
- **Validation and Accuracy Checks:** Implemented consistency checks and error handling to ensure that filled forms adhere to official requirements and reduce user mistakes.

  ### Data
- **[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)](https://www.uscis.gov/):** Official forms, instructions, and eligibility criteria were downloaded and used to train the model on accurate form completion.  
- **[Customs and Border Protection (CBP)](https://www.cbp.gov/):** Metadata and documentation from CBP were included to provide guidance on entry, travel, and border-related queries.  
- **[Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)](https://www.justice.gov/eoir):** Legal documents and procedural information from EOIR were used to ensure accurate responses on hearings, appeals, and immigration court processes.  
- **[Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)](https://www.ice.gov/):** Relevant forms, policies, and guidelines from ICE were incorporated to provide users with reliable compliance and enforcement information.  

All data was **curated directly from official sources**, extracted for metadata, and structured to train the LLM. This ensures BureauBot delivers **accurate, trustworthy, and domain-specific guidance** for users navigating the U.S. immigration system.
