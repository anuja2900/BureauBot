You file (i.e. sign) this form when posting a bond for release from ICE custody, typically at an ICE field office or through an authorized surety. To use it, you must be an eligible obligor (the person or surety posting the bond), provide identification and bond details, and accept responsibility that the alien will comply with the bond’s terms (e.g., appear for hearings, obey removal orders).
ice_form_i352a: ICE Form I-352A, titled Notice to Cash Bond Obligors – IRS “Backup Withholding” Rules, is used to inform cash bond obligors (those who posted an immigration bond in cash) about IRS backup withholding requirements. When an immigration cash bond is canceled or breached and interest payments are due, ICE uses this form to collect tax withholding information via IRS Form W-9 (for U.S. persons) or W-8BEN (for nonresident aliens). Eligibility to submit relies on being the cash bond obligor (the person who provided the cash bond) and receiving interest payments from ICE; you must provide your taxpayer identification status via the appropriate IRS form.
